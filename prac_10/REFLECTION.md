# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually the time estimate was roughly 5 minutes either side. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I think at the start my estimate was like 10 minutes between when I guessed and when I finished, however as I went on 
I lowered the amount to closer to 5 minutes

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I think it helps a programmer to be able to read instructions and to roughly estimate how long a program will take.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I think that its pretty useful to have another set of eyes, look through your work. Because u wrote the
code it looks like there is no mistakes for you, but others will be able to pick up mistakes that you can change

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I think I have learnt even more so that testing is vital to producing good code, many of the code I reviewed when I put
it into my own pycharm, did not even start/or crashed.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Sebered prac_07 code review](https://github.com/Sebered/cp1404practicals/pull/4#event-15323424310)

### Explanation

Here this students work was done fairly well, all the programs worked and functioned properly. However I found many
smaller mistakes and names that could be changed to improve code, I mentioned these is a open way such as "is there a 
better name for 'this' ". I think this code review was good because it allowed this student to go in a fix these smaller
mistakes that he would probably not see when looking through his own code

### Good Code Review 2

[Thantthuauang- code review prac_06](https://github.com/thantthuaung/cp1404parcticals/pull/3#pullrequestreview-2425619394)

### Explanation

In this code review I took a little bit different approach, I saw that a few of the programs were not working as intended
so I let some of the smaller mistakes go unnoticed to make sure the student would focus on the bigger mistakes, as  I 
did not want to overwhelm them with too many comments/improvements, again this was done in an open/suggestive way

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think I would put a little bit more emphasis on the code reviews, I felt like half the weeks I never got sent any code
to review or didn't get any feedback, and half of my feedback was just "good"

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I did a good job at not using the solution answers until I was done with my program. This allowed me to asses
my learning and allow me to learn from best practices and what I can do better.
