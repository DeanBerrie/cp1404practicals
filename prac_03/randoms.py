"""
What did you see on line 1? On line 1 I ran it 3 times and got 11, 15, and 20.
However I could have got any number between 5-20

What did you see on line 2? I ran the statment multiple times and got 3,5,7, and 9. This is because
the range starts at 3 and only includes every 2nd number up to 10.

What did you see on line 3? when ran I got the floats 4.1, 4.86, and 3.8. Uniform prints the floats of a
number between the parametres in this case 2.5-5.5
